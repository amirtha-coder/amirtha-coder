 *More about me*

I am working currently as a Healthcare Support Worker Apprentice in Birmingham. I have always loved computers, and it has been a fascination of mine for life; I finally decided to explore my adoration for coding by starting. 🤓 😁 I am passionate about teaching, and I hope that my GitHub repositories will show the expanse of all the knowledge that I can use to educate others.

 ### Thank you for clicking on to my github account - have a wonderful day 🥰 !
